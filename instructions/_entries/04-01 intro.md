### Solution

The first two labs focused on utilizing Dapr as standalone software, running either locally or as a sidecar in environments such as Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes. This provides great flexibility, allowing Dapr to be employed in various scenarios and environments.

By running Dapr as a sidecar, it becomes easier to integrate Dapr as a feature into PaaS (Platform as a Service) services. This eliminates operational concerns related to managing the Dapr process for each service, enabling developers to concentrate more on developing their application's features.

In summary, Dapr can be employed in a versatile manner, either as standalone software in a local environment or as a sidecar for PaaS services, offering a flexible and development-oriented solution.
