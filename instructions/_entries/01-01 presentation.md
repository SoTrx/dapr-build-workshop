[Dapr](https://dapr.io/) (Distributed Application Runtime) is a program that facilitates communication between the services of an application. Using the [_sidecar_](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar) model, this program is designed to run "alongside" a service to provide additional functionalities. The two processes are then independent and communicate through their _localhost_ interfaces.

The goal of Dapr is to enable **application decoupling**, meaning to reduce the number of strong dependencies between the services of an application.
