### SDKs and Unified Conventions

So far, we have focused on using the REST API provided by Dapr. In addition to being language-agnostic, it is also an excellent way to understand the workings of the software.

However, in real deployments, relying solely on HTTP makes the developer responsible for maintaining the written HTTP wrapper, which can lead to technical debt. To address this issue, there are [SDKs](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/) specific to each language.

The supported languages are:

- [dotnet](https://github.com/dapr/dotnet-sdk)
- [Python](https://github.com/dapr/python-sdk)
- [Java](https://github.com/dapr/java-sdk)
- [Go](https://github.com/dapr/go-sdk)
- [PHP](https://github.com/dapr/php-sdk)
- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/dapr/js-sdk)
- [C++](https://github.com/dapr/cpp-sdk) (Alpha, as of 07/2022)
- [Rust](https://github.com/dapr/rust-sdk) (Alpha, as of 07/2022)

While it may not be necessary to detail each SDK, it is important to note that **they are designed with a unified convention**.

We will always find:

- A _Client_ SDK, encapsulating all methods **initiated by the application**

  - Example: Publishing to a topic, retrieving and publishing state

- A _Server_ SDK, encapsulating all methods **where the application is notified of an event**

  - Example: Subscribing to a topic. Once the subscription is made, the Dapr server waits for a message and recalls the application with the content of the received message.

- An _Actors_ SDK designed to interact with the actor model

For example, a call to retrieve the state of the **statestore** state management component:

HTTP

```sh
GET http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore
```

Go SDK:

```golang
// Empty context
ctx := context.Background()
state, _ := client.GetState(ctx, "statestore", "<key>")
```

> **Note**: As mentioned [here](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/sdk-serialization/), Dapr SDKs will serialize data in JSON by default. Therefore, any object sent must be convertible to one of the [types supported by JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp). It would not be possible (nor desirable) to pass functions through the SDKs, for example.
