In this second Lab, we will explore additional features introduced by Dapr through a new application that will evolve as we progress through the exercises.

This new application will allow pre-ordering a very specific product. It also has a unique characteristic â€“ all its services are coded in different languages.

Implementations of the various services used are provided for reference in the `src/Lab2/implementations` folder.

However, it is important to note that the purpose of this exercise is not to delve into the code of the services but rather to understand how an equivalent level of service can be achieved independently of the languages used.
